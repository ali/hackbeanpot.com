    <h1>For Sponsors</h1>

    <p>
    We're bringing together the smartest college students around, and want you to be involved.
    </p>

    <p>All sponsors will be listed on promotional materials (website, fliers, posters, shirts) and given a brief time to announce their involvement, including prizes, at the event.</p>

    <p>Here are some of the things we're looking for:</p>

      <li>5 minutes to promote yourself at the beginning and end</li>
      <li>Resumes from interested students who drop theirs off</li>
      <li>Create a fun event of your choice</li>
      <li>Create a prize of your choice.</li>
      <li>One judge will be from your company</li>
      <li>Logo placed prominently on all promotional material</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In return, you'll be sponsoring a major part of the event, including the venue, food, shirts, shirts and more. The minimum sponsorship at this level is $2000.</p>
